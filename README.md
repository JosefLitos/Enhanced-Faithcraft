# Enhanced Faithcraft

- [Compliance x32](https://compliancepack.net/compliance32x/latest) is a dependency, this is just an extensive addon
- Optifine is not required, but enables more textures and makes the game look better
- works with Continuity mod
- support for FabricSkyBoxes, but Optifine looks better
- please remove `assets/minecraft/optifine/ctm/bookshelf` folder from Compliance to make the Juknum's texture work
  properly

## Config

This pack has 4 variants for better performace or better looks of leaves, to change the version, go to
`assets/minecraft/models/3d/version` and rename the version you want to 'current' A good tip: rename the
previous version to the one absent, available versions are: `light`, `medium`, `heavy`, `extreme`

For more bushy leaves and more depth of wood logs use `heavy`.
For a compromise of looks and performance use `medium`.
For avoiding bushy leaves and jams on logs use `light`.

- [AudioCraft sounds](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/audiocraft)

Huge love to all the creators, their work was inspirational to me and added up to, at least in my
oppinion, a wonderful combination. Enjoy the sounds but be aware of extreme AudioCraft sounds loudness
as I didn't want to lower the sound quality by adjusting all the used sounds.
