# Enhanced Faithcraft

- [Compliance x32](https://compliancepack.net/compliance32x/latest) is a dependency, this is just an extensive addon
- Optifine is not required, but enables more textures and makes the game look better
- works with Continuity mod
- support for FabricSkyBoxes, but Optifine looks better
- please remove `assets/minecraft/optifine/ctm/bookshelf` folder from Compliance to make the Juknum's texture work
  properly

## Config

This pack has 4 variants for better performace or better looks of leaves,
to change the version, go to
`assets/minecraft/models/3d/leaves_version`
and rename the version you want to 'current'
A good tip: rename the previous version to the one absent,
e.g.: file names are: `'current', 'heavy_culling', 'light', 'medium'`
so the current version is heavy_culling

```
I want heavy version so I:
rename 'current' to 'heavy_no_culling'
rename 'heavy_culling' to 'current'
```

Huge love to all the creators, their work was inspirational to me and added up to, at least in my
oppinion, a wonderful combination. Enjoy the sounds but be aware of extreme AudioCraft sounds loudness
as I didn't want to lower the sound quality by adjusting all the used sounds.
