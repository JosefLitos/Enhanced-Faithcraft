# Enhanced Faithcraft

This pack features:

- connected textures (CTM)
- extensive block variants (all brick types, ores...)
- bushy leaves
- custom sky (dramatic-skys converted for [FabricSkyBoxes](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabricskyboxes/versions))
- long grass blocks
- 3D door, fence and log models
- 3D rails
- 3D tulips and a few other flowers
- 3D models for most utility blocks

## Compatibility

- [Faithful x32](https://faithfulpack.net/faithful32x/latest) is a dependency, this is just an extensive addon
- Optifine is not required, but enables more textures and makes the game look better
- best with Continuity mod
- door and fence models are x16 compatible
- support for FabricSkyBoxes, but Optifine original looks better
- please remove `assets/minecraft/optifine/ctm/bookshelf` folder from Compliance to make the Juknum's texture work
  properly

## Config

This pack has 2 variants for better performace or better looks of leaves, to change the version, go to
`assets/minecraft/models/3d/version` and rename the version you want to `current`.
Available are: `light`, `heavy`

For more bushy leaves and more depth of wood logs use `heavy`.
For avoiding bushy leaves and jams on logs use `light`.

Huge love to all the creators, their work was inspirational to me and added up to, at least in my
oppinion, a wonderful compilation.
